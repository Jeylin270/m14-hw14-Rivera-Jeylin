          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I come from a family of immigrants who instilled in me the value of hard work and perseverance. As a first-generation college student, I've broken new ground in my family's educational journey, becoming not only the first to earn a bachelor's degree but also the first to obtain a master's degree. My Mexican heritage is a source of immense pride, shaping my worldview and fueling my determination to succeed. The rich cultural tapestry of my background has instilled in me a deep appreciation for education and creativity. I constantly seek out diverse ways to express myself creatively and keep my mind engaged, whether through art, writing, or exploring new skills. This drive to learn and create not only honors my family's sacrifices but also propels me forward in my personal and professional growth. My journey as a first-generation graduate student is a testament to the power of education and the resilience of immigrant families, and I'm excited to continue pushing boundaries and exploring new horizons.</p>
